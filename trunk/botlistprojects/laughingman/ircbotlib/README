This is manderlbot, an attempt to write an irc bot in erlang, with a XML
based configuration.

To use it, install erlang, then xmerl-0.15
	http://www.erlang.org/user.html#xmerl-0.15

On my system this means install the compiled files in
	/usr/lib/erlang/lib/xmerl-0.15

make install will provide you /usr/bin/manderlbot to start the bot.
If you have installed the debian package, you don't have to make
install.

Once manderlbot is running, you can obtain a shell on the erlang VM it
is running in, by launching another VM and connecting to the former.

erl -setcookie mdb -sname control

(control@node)1> 

Then you hit ^G and connect to the manderlbot VM:
User switch command
 --> r manderlbot@node
 --> c 3

If you want to stop manderlbot, you can now type in
(manderlbot@node)1> application:stop(manderlbot).
