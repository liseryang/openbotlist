Overview
===================

Botlist is a social bookmarking web application that contains a news aggregating/news/article submission site. There is also an ads listing section so that users can post personal/ad profiles. The application itself is created with the following libraries; JRuby and J2EE's Spring framework as a middleware piece, Hibernate for object relational mapping (ORM). It is designed to run with Tomcat but should work with other J2EE servers. Search functionality uses the Lucene API.
