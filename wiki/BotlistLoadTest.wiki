= Description =

During the development of Botlist, it became necessary to create a testing framework 
that would crawl various pieces of the application and extract response/time
 data and other various pieces of information. Here is the source 
and executable of that framework. It is a java based tool and highly configurable. 
It will not be as robust as grinder or other tools, but still useful for resting anyway.

= Cont =

The following is a simple java based system for testing the responses from a web server
 or servlet engine like tomcat. Currently, it has minimal support for SSL/HTTPS connectivity, 
cookies, sessions,caching of responses, script file for request workflow.

Source is provided (see LoadTestManager.java) and totals only 2000 lines of java source. 
I would also suggest using this library along with a JVM languagelike JRuby or Jython.

= Usage =

Create a script to launch 
(include the following libraries in your classpath,
 botlistloadtest.jar, ibatis-2.3.0.677.jar, jruby.jar, lucene-core-2.1.0.jar)
org.spirit.loadtest.LoadTestManager -f -f testclient.properties


See the Win32 example:
Launch load_test.bat

Or, you change directory to the 'bin' directory to see
a JRuby based load test example.
