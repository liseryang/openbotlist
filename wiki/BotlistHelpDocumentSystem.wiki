#summary Botlist help document system

= Introduction =

This is a small utility for indexing developer help documents with Lucene.  And because some botlist documents have already been indexed, you can use it to search for Botlist documentation.

= Specification =

  * Index simple text based help documents, loaded from a input directory
  * Developer should be able to query documents through command-line interface
  * Shall be able to load text help document in the command-line interface based on a search query term.

= Usage =

Ideally, this tool is used for those interested in the botlist application that would like help information.  At present, most of the help documents center around source code (E.g. a developer may want to search for "String")
 
There are two scripts, bothelp.sh and helpindex.sh for using the help tool.

Use 'bothelp.sh' to actually search for a particular term:

{{{ 
 $ bin/bothelp.sh
 
Query>>>  Search Help System (Botlist Help Documents)
Query>>>  v0.1 [Nov14.2007]
Query>>>  At the prompt, enter search help term
Query>>>  Use :quit to exit command loop.
Query>>>  ===================
Query>>>String
}}}
