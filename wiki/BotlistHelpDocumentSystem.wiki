#summary Botlist help document system

= Introduction =

This is a small utility for indexing developer help documents with Lucene.  And because some botlist documents have already been indexed, you can use it to search for Botlist documentation.

= Specification =

  * Index simple text based help documents, loaded from a input directory (placed in input_docs directory)
  * Developer should be able to query documents through command-line interface
  * Developer shall be able to load a particular text help document through the command-line interface based on a search query term.

= Purpose =

Typically, a developer will put documentation last on their list of things to do.  They may go so far as to document their source, but they probably have neglected to create external documentation to help users or aid other developers that may maintain their project in the future.  This is especially true for open source projects.  I developed this very simple approach for dropping simple text files in a directory than with Lucene indexing to be searched later.  For example, I can create simple 5-10 line text documents to describe a particular piece of functionality:

{{{
Whatisbotlist.txt:

What is the purpose of botlist?

Botlist is an online news aggregation application.
}}}

Put this file in the input_docs directory, re-index the directory and then I am able to search for fuzzy terms associated with documents as they are added.  (E.g. I might search 'purpose' in the example above.  As a side-note, this application and example were put together over the course of about 12 hours, only skimming the surface of how useful this approach can be to your project.  For example, you may a small utility around a web application or some other document management system.

= Usage =
 
There are two executable bash scripts located in the bin directory of the project; *bothelp.sh* and *helpindex.sh*.

Use 'bothelp.sh' to actually search for a particular term and 'helpindex.sh' to actually index the documents in the *runtime/input_docs*:

{{{ 
 $ bin/bothelp.sh
 
Query>>>  Search Help System (Botlist Help Documents)
Query>>>  v0.1 [Nov14.2007]
Query>>>  At the prompt, enter search help term
Query>>>  Use :quit to exit command loop.
Query>>>  ===================
Query>>>String
}}}
