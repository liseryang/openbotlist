=Behaviour testing with JRuby/Spring and Hibernate=

= Introduction =

Botlist wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for the "creative" testing used.  Most of the tests aren't low-level, component tests like unit tests (there are some but not many), but the majority of the tests are "behaviour-driven" tests.  "By asking questions such as "What should this application do?" or "What should this part do?" For example, the Botverse section of Botlist lists a collection of links that are submitted by the user.  Here is a simple test that tests this particular functionality.  We only focus on the query needed to display the links.

{{{
def test()	

    c = @ac.getBean("radController")    

    # Run the standard botverse, entity links query

    dao = c.entityLinksDao

    query = "from org.spirit.bean.impl.BotListEntityLinks as links order by links.createdOn desc"    

    links = dao.pageEntityLinks(query, 0, 4)

    links.each { |eLink|

		puts eLink.urlTitle

	}

    sessFact = dao.sessionFactory

    logStatistics(sessFact)

	logQueryStatistics(sessFact, query)

  end
}}}
