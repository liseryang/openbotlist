  Made some more progress with the ebotlist, yaws, mnesia application including creating a make build file and deployment scripts for deploying the needed files to the yaws ebin, include, and view directories.  These are simple tasks but vital to being able to work with yaws.  In some respects, yaws has some similar traits with a J2EE application.  Especially in terms of separating the application objects (emulator beam files) away from the script server pages (yaws files).
  {{{
The following yaws snippet (server side include) includes the following partial page
 	<erl>
		out(A) -> { yssi, "general/botverse_link_css.yaws" }.
	</erl>
I used the following code, below to return the links in my database

out(Args) ->
	botlist_find_links:find_links(),
	{ html, "Data Results" }.

  *Launching Yaws for local development*

  It isn't critical, but I had trouble working with the yaws interactive environment.  I would much prefer to launch yaws in *daemon* code and I am lazy.  Here are a set of alias definitions you can place in your .bashrc file (note: you would have to copy exactly).
   {{{

# Yaws easy commands == note embedding the single quote
alias yaws='yaws --daemon --id myserver --mnesiadir '\''"/usr/local/var/yaws/db/Mnesia_botlist_nonode"'\'''

alias ykill='yaws --daemon --id myserver --stop'
alias ylogs='tail -n 800 -f /usr/local/var/log/yaws/report.log'
# End of yaws commands ==

}}}

  I am making good progress on converting parts of the botlist project to erlang through yaws and mnesia.  Both projects are amazing in terms of the features they; redundancy, truly concurrent and fast.  The buzz online about Mnesia has remarked that Mnesia doesn't handle large datasets over tens of millions of records.  My response to that is that future mnesia and erlang releases may resolve issue.  Plus, some would argue that MySQL doesn't handle large datasets.
  Here is in essence a simple "find" call with Mnsesia
{{{
find_links() ->
    F = fun() ->
		WP = mnesia:table_info(entity_links, wild_pattern),
		[EntityLink || EntityLink <- mnesia:match_object(WP)]
        end,
    case mnesia:transaction(F) of
        {atomic, Result}  -> {ok, Result};
        {aborted, Reason} -> {error, Reason}
    end.

}}}

  Look for project updates associated with the project (ebotlist, erlang botlist).
