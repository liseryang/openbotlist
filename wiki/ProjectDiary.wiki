= Using Factor Language for Botlist Analysis =
  The Botlist data repository is pretty large right now.  There are over 400 thousand links.  I added 50 thousand over the weekend I will try to get to half a million by the end of the week and a million by the end of November.  It doesn't make sense to use some of the mainstream languages that are out there.  The Factor programming language is designed to be fast with speed and reliability in mind, so it would make an ideal tool to analyze the botlist URL data.  I want to look at basic utilities like map-reduce algorithms, fuzzy algorithms, decision tree analysis, and other statistics.  I have only a little code now, but here are some useful Factor notes that I had relearn:  (currently using Factor 0.90+ [from the GIT repository]).
  {{{
Launching Factor source with a bash script (0.90+ code):

#!/bin/sh
# 'factor' executable name changed from to 'f' to avoid conflicts
/home/downloads9/factor/f -e='"csvparser" run' -quiet -run=none

  }}}

  Made some more progress with the ebotlist, yaws, mnesia application including creating a make build file and deployment scripts for deploying the needed files to the yaws ebin, include, and view directories.  These are simple tasks but vital to being able to work with yaws.  In some respects, yaws has some similar traits with a J2EE application.  Especially in terms of separating the application objects (emulator beam files) away from the script server pages (yaws files).
  {{{
The following yaws snippet (server side include) includes the following partial page
 	<erl>
		out(A) -> { yssi, "general/botverse_link_css.yaws" }.
	</erl>
I used the following code, below to return the links in my database

out(Args) ->
	botlist_find_links:find_links(),
	{ html, "Data Results" }.

  =Launching Yaws for local development=

  It isn't critical, but I had trouble working with the yaws interactive environment.  I would much prefer to launch yaws in daemon code and I am lazy.  Here are a set of alias definitions you can place in your bashrc file (note: you would have to copy exactly)
   {{{
alias yaws='yaws --daemon --id myserver --mnesiadir '\''"/usr/local/var/yaws/db/Mnesia_botlist_nonode"'\'''

alias ykill='yaws --daemon --id myserver --stop'
alias ylogs='tail -n 800 -f /usr/local/var/log/yaws/report.log'
}}}

  I am making good progress on converting parts of the botlist project to erlang through yaws and mnesia.  Both projects are amazing in terms of the features they; redundancy, truly concurrent and fast.  The buzz online about Mnesia has remarked that Mnesia doesn't handle large datasets over tens of millions of records.  My response to that is that future mnesia and erlang releases may resolve issue.  Plus, some would argue that MySQL doesn't handle large datasets.
  Here is in essence a simple "find" call with Mnsesia
{{{
find_links() ->
    F = fun() ->
		WP = mnesia:table_info(entity_links, wild_pattern),
		[EntityLink || EntityLink <- mnesia:match_object(WP)]
        end,
    case mnesia:transaction(F) of
        {atomic, Result}  -> {ok, Result};
        {aborted, Reason} -> {error, Reason}
    end.

}}}

  Look for project updates associated with the project (ebotlist, erlang botlist).
